# Diversity and Inclusion Checklist
A practical guide for designers to help ensure Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) is built into any future-state experience. This project is intended to bring awareness of issues around race, gender, inclusion, and more. Also, it can serve as a starting point for diversity & inclusion optimization in design work. This list will continue to evolve as we keep learning and practicing activism through design.
